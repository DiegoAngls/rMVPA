Multivoxel Pattern Analysis in R

### Introduction

'rMVPA' is an R library for multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data. The goal of this library is to make MVPA analyses easy. It can be used both programmatically from within R or using a command line interface. 'rMVPA' leverages the 'caret' library for the underlying machine learning interface. What 'rMVPA' provides is the infrastructure for conducting machine learning analyses on neuroimaging data.
